# Data Extraction Feature

## Overview

The **Data Extraction** feature in **YAMS** is designed to convert raw binary sensor data into a human-readable CSV format. This tool simplifies the process of working with physiological (PPG) and motion (IMU) data by extracting and organizing them by subject.

## How It Works

The data extraction tool takes raw binary files as input and processes them into structured CSV files. Each subject’s PPG and IMU data are parsed separately. 


## How to Use

1. Open **YAMS**.
2. Navigate to the **🛠️ Data Extractor** tab.
3. In the **Input directory** field, specify the folder containing the raw binary files.
4. In the **Output directory** field, specify where the extracted CSV files should be saved.
5. (Uncommon) Check "legacy sampling rate" box if the data was collected on a older firmware version. Do NOT check this box if using firmware >- 4.5.3.
6. Once all fields are completed, click the **Extract raw data** button to begin the process.


## Expected Input Structure

The input folder should contain raw binary files with filenames in the following format:

- `<subject_id>ppg<reference_timestamp>.bin` – for PPG data
- `<subject_id>ac<reference_timestamp>.bin` – for IMU (accelerometer) data

Each filename encodes the **subject ID** and a **reference timestamp**, which the extractor uses to group data accordingly. It is untypical but in some cases, **subject ID** can be empty.

## Output Format

The extractor generates one CSV file for each type of data per subject:

- For each unique `<subject_id>` in the input folder:
  - One **PPG** CSV file
  - One **Accelerometer** CSV file

## Command line usage

Most common (e.g., firmware >= 4.5)

- `python -m yams.data_extraction -i <path/to/binary/data> -o <path/to/output>` 

Not common. For firmware with 25 Hz sampling rate

- `python -m yams.data_extraction -i <path/to/binary/data> -o <path/to/output> --legacy_fs`
